# Jackson for Bukkit

This package contains serialization and deserialization tools to serialize a couple of different bukkit classes. The reason to choose this over GSON is that I've created a [tool](https://github.com/kh498/HandcraftObjectsTool) that helps creating serialized JVM objects using Jackson as it's converter.
