# BukkitUtil

Various utilites for easier programming in bukkit. Some might require protocol lib (eks [AdvancedChat](https://github.com/kh498/Bukkit-Util/blob/master/src/main/java/no/kh498/util/AdvancedChat.java#L70)). Everything is version independent and no NMS code has been used. 

For more general java utilities see [CommonUtilsJava](https://github.com/kh498/CommonUtilsJava) and for easier command creation you can use [BukkitCommandAPI](https://github.com/kh498/BukkitCommandAPI). Both can be used with maven.
